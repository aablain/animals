            This is "Carl", the Cheetah! He's spent most of his life chasing down           preditors in the great saharrah, but now he's looking for someplace to settle down; he's ready to sink his teeth into a life of pethood. If you like the idea of never being able to outrun your deadly pet, then Carl is the pet for you!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bonus:</strong> Carl <em>WILL</em> catch any burglers..

          <p>
            Pam here is quite the loud mouth. If you say it, she'll repeat it. A former copy machine for the FLinston's, she's ready to retire into a less taxing work-position. If you want to hear what all your friends and family said while your were gone, look no further! Her beak is the beak of truth. (As a side note, if she won't stop talking try saying "silence"- maybe she'll repeat that?)
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bonus:</strong> Pam won't let you forget

          <p>
            Marcus.. Well, here's the thing with Marcus: he's pretty much the easiest pet to own. All the guy seems to do is chill. If your looking for a fun entertaining pet, Marcus is nit the pet for you. However, if you're looking for a buddy to chill on the couch with, this is your partner in crime. Just be sure you keep your pantry stock full of bananas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bonus:</strong> Marcus will eat all the bugs out of your hair

          <h3>The Alligator</h3>
          <img src="img/alligator.jpg" alt="A photo of a alligator">
          <p>
            Al here likes to smile. All the time... He's a great friend to share selfies with (just don't get too close). If you want to ride an animal to work, how about Al? Everyone can ride a horse- but if you adopt Al, you can ride an alligator to work! I mean common, what's cooler than that?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Bonus:</strong> He cuddle's well.
